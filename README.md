### Project Report

### Context
Social media is increasingly being used to share events, express dissatisfaction, and report incidents — often accompanied by strong emotions. With advances in data science, it has become possible to collect information from the internet and perform meaningful analyses to extract valuable insights.

This project focuses specifically on incidents related to armed robberies and flooding.

### Objectives

### Flooding

Identify areas most affected by flooding in order to implement preventive measures such as water retention systems and related solutions.

Armed Robberies and Thefts

Identify the most impacted areas to alert the relevant authorities so they can take appropriate public safety measures.

### Study Results

### Robberies

Lomé and Déckon were identified as the areas most affected by armed robberies.

### Flooding

### Limitations

The data comes exclusively from web scraping, which may limit the representativeness of the results.

The scope of the data is restricted to a few localities and may not fully reflect the overall situation.

Data from additional channels would improve the reliability and robustness of the findings.

Despite potential biases due to data quality and quantity, the current results provide useful information for understanding trends related to flooding and robberies in the studied areas.
